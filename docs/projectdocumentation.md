Multi-Agent Content Generation System

Kasparro – Applied AI Engineer Challenge
🚀 How to Run the System (Important – Read First)

1. How the System Takes Input

    The system accepts raw product data from the user in a single text input, entered at runtime through the terminal.

    The input must follow this fixed, semicolon-separated format:
            Product Name;
            Concentration;
            Skin Types (comma-separated);
            Ingredients (comma-separated);
            Benefits (comma-separated);
            How to Use;
            Side Effects;
            Price
    The user provides all product information at once.
    The system internally parses this raw input into a structured schema and passes it through the agentic pipeline.
2. How to Run the Program

    From the project root directory:

    python main.py
    You will be prompted to paste the raw product data in the specified format.

    Example Inputs:
        Eg 1: GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum; 10% Vitamin C; Oily, Combination; Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid; Brightening, Fades dark spots; Apply 2–3 drops in the morning before sunscreen; Mild tingling for sensitive skin; 699

        Eg2: AquaFresh Niacinamide Serum; 5% Niacinamide; Dry, Sensitive; Niacinamide, Ceramides; Hydration, Barrier repair; Apply at night after cleansing; None reported; 599
     
        Eg3 : PureRadiance Face Serum; 15% Vitamin C; Normal, Combination; Vitamin C; Improves glow, Evens skin tone; Use once daily in the morning; Slight dryness initially; 799

Output Generated by the System

After input is provided, the system automatically generates and overwrites the following machine-readable JSON files:

        outputs/
        ├── faq.json
        ├── product_page.json
        ├── comparison_page.json


1. Problem Statement

    The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a modular, agentic automation system that converts raw product information into structured, machine-readable content pages.

    The system must:

    operate strictly on user-provided data

    avoid external knowledge or research

    generate content through a multi-agent architecture

    output clean JSON suitable for downstream systems

    The focus of the challenge is system design, agent orchestration, and modular automation, not UI or copywriting.

2. Solution Overview

    The solution is implemented as a multi-agent pipeline, where each agent performs a single, well-defined responsibility.

    The system workflow consists of:

    Parsing raw user input into structured data

    Validating and normalizing product information

    Generating categorized user questions

    Applying reusable content logic blocks

    Assembling pages using custom templates

    Writing final outputs as JSON files

    This design ensures extensibility, reusability, and clean separation of concerns.

3. Scope & Assumptions
    Scope

    The system processes one product at a time.

    Input is provided as raw text via the terminal.

    Output is strictly JSON (no UI or HTML).

    Generated pages:

    FAQ Page

    Product Page

    Comparison Page

    Assumptions

    Input follows the documented format.

    The comparison product is fictional and internally defined.

    No external APIs or datasets are used.

    4.2 Agent Responsibilities
        Product Parser Agent

        Converts parsed input into a validated product model.

        Ensures consistent internal representation.

        Question Generator Agent

        Automatically generates categorized user questions.

        Provides structured input for FAQ generation.

        Page Assembly Agent

        Orchestrates templates and logic blocks.

        Writes final JSON outputs.

        Agents do not directly depend on each other and communicate only via structured data.

        4.3 Content Logic Blocks

        Content logic blocks are reusable transformation units that derive structured content from product data.

    Examples:

        Benefits Logic Block

        Usage Logic Block

        Safety Logic Block

        FAQ Answer Logic Block

        Comparison Logic Block

        These blocks contain no orchestration or template logic.

    4.4 Template Engine

        Templates define the structure of each page type and assemble content by invoking logic blocks.

        Implemented templates:

        FAQ Template

        Product Page Template

        Comparison Page Template

        Templates are responsible only for composition, not content generation.

    4.5 Orchestration Model

        The system follows a controller-driven pipeline:

        Execution order is managed centrally.

        Agents are loosely coupled.

        Data flows in a single direction.

        This design ensures clarity, testability, and scalability.

5. Conclusion

    This project demonstrates a production-style agentic content generation system that accepts raw human input, transforms it into structured data, and generates machine-readable outputs using modular agents.

        The architecture emphasizes:

        clear agent boundaries

        reusable logic

        deterministic behavior

        clean automation flow
